Much work done as well as most forum posts addressed.
0.9.00 pre 2 released.

18/10/05
------------
0.9.00 pre released to testers.
Much work done on audit.vbs and admin_add_pc_new*.php - no longer need MyODBC installed. Audit.vbs outputs to admin_add_pc_new.php -> this is submitted to admin_add_pc_new_2.php which contains all the logic for inserting & updating the DB. NO logic is now in audit.vbs.


03/09/05
------------
Added alternative icon set - Win (guess where they're from).

26/08/05
------------

------------

Added alternative icon set - nuoveXT from kde-look.org


18/08/05
------------

Tested against our domain - seems to detect multiple NICs & monitors correctly
Altered nmap.vbs to account for uuid instead of mac on PCs
Altered nmap.vbs to show on screen when nothing at an IPAddress


17/08/05
------------
Fixed audit.vbs where if auditing a machine with supplied credentials, partitons would not report correctly
As above, fixed audit.vbs for monitor detection
Cleaned up monitor detection
Altered all tables to allow for enough characters in the linked mac address fields - now 100, for use by system_uuid


15/08/05
------------
Updated the projects homepage.
Started language translation


12/08/05
------------
Added monitor detect script from the forums - thank-you Mancha
Had to alter the database - added a monitor table, and removed the monitor details from system table.
Seems to work fine for all our systems, except one laptop (an IBM Thinkpad 28818PM).


11/08/05
------------
Fixed two bugs in setup.php (missing ;)


10/08/05
------------
Added ability to sort by columns on List Software page

Fixed software count in List All Software Page
Changed Date Auditied column on Listing pages to only show date - not date + time.
  To change back, see line 500
Altered audit.vbs to enable online = "ie"
  online = "ie" is mainly for running the script on individual PCs, but without having to install MyODBC
  online = "ie" uses an instance of Internet Explorer (not shown), and pipes the created SQL to a text box, then clicks the Submit button, then closes the instance
  online = "ie" doesn't "talk" to the database (only to the text box in IE), so it cannot query the database
  online = "ie" acts like an Offline audit (it cannot "update" software, only delete all software for a system, then add all detected software - see last point)
  online = "ie" uses the page admin_pc_add_remote.php
  online = "ie" can have the database username & password removed
  online = "ie" audit.vbs with username & password removed could be places in the webroot & a link given to employees to click (and RUN the script, not save it)
  online = "ie" could be emailed to employees (with instructions to run the script)
  online = "ie" could be setup in login scripts
  


3/6/05
------------
